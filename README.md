[<img src="./assets/images/getItGithub.png" alt="GitHub" height="80">](https://github.com/ankushcodes69/AudioScape/releases/latest)

## ü§ù Contributing

**You need a YouTube 'po token' api to develop the app yourself**

- You can find the code for the api at: https://github.com/ankushcodes69/YouTubeApi

- You can either host the api locally or use "https://render.com/" to host the api (recommended), either way add the link to a **.env** (reffer to .env.example) file and **don't forget to give '/data' at the end of the api link**.

_Example :_

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_PO_TOKEN_API="https://<your render project name>.onrender.com/data"
```

**Pull requests are welcome**

- If you want to **develop new functions** or **fix a bug**, fork the repository and send a pull request.
